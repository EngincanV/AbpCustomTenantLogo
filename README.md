# AbpCustomTenantLogo

In multi-tenant applications built with ABP Framework, customizing the tenant's branding elements like logos is a common requirement. While [ASP.NET Zero](https://docs.aspnetzero.com/common/latest/Features-Mvc-Core-Tenant-Settings#appearance) provides this feature out of the box, implementing it in a standard ABP application requires some custom development.

In this repository, I show you how to implement a custom tenant logo feature in an ABP application. It's a simple yet effective approach that you can later extend and customize according to your specific needs.
